## Ideas / ToDos 

- /comics 
  - retrieve comics with image (wookieepedia thumbnail)
    - save file in memory and immediately delete again?
- /status
  - show all items in memory to make sure they actually get deleted if they have to?
    - (preventing the memory to fill up with e.g. one-time-use image)
    - seperate /memory button that is offered with the /status message?
